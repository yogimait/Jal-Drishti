"""
PhoneCameraSource: Alternative video source that receives frames from phone camera via WebSocket.

This module provides a video source class with the SAME interface as RawVideoSource,
allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement for the FrameScheduler.

Integration Notes:
- FrameScheduler expects a video source with a read() generator that yields (frame, frame_id, timestamp)
- This class uses a thread-safe queue to receive frames from the WebSocket upload handler
- The scheduler thread calls read() which blocks on the queue, just like RawVideoSource blocks on cv2.VideoCapture
- NO CHANGES to FrameScheduler, ML Bridge, or SAFE MODE logic are required
